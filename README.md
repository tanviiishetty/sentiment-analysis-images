# Sentiment-analysis-images
Sentiment analysis using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict emotions from facial expression images.

## Overview
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for sentiment analysis on facial images. Using deep learning techniques with TensorFlow and Keras, the model accurately classifies emotions based on facial expressions.

## Features
Efficient CNN architecture tailored for image-based sentiment classification

Trained on the publicly available FER2013 dataset

Implemented and tested in Google Colab for ease of use

Visualizes training progress through accuracy and loss graphs

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (optional, for image preprocessing)

Install dependencies via:
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib opencv-python

###Usage
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-images.git
cd sentiment-analysis-images

Open the notebook in Google Colab or your local environment and run the code.

##Model Architecture
The CNN model includes multiple convolutional and max-pooling layers followed by fully connected dense layers, culminating in a softmax output layer to classify multiple emotion categories.

##Results
Model accuracy: 55% 
Training and validation metrics are plotted within the notebook.
