# Sentiment-analysis-images
Sentiment analysis using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict emotions from facial expression images.

# Overview
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for sentiment analysis on facial images. Using deep learning techniques with TensorFlow and Keras, the model accurately classifies emotions based on facial expressions.

## Features
Efficient CNN architecture tailored for image-based sentiment classification

Trained on the publicly available FER2013 dataset

Implemented and tested in Google Colab for ease of use

Visualizes training progress through accuracy and loss graphs

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
